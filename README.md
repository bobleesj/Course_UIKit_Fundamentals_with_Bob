## Reference
This is a platform for my students to download the source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less traveled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.

> Until the course get officially released, please consider it as a rough draft.
